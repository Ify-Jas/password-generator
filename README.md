This is a password generator challenge using Javascript.

This week's challenge was to create a password generator using Javascript. This allowed me to use all that we have learnt so far in Javascript including setting up functions and calling them. Also, the use of built in Javascript functions such as alert, prompt and confirm.

It started of difficult but with further research and input from tutors, I was able to get on the front foot and complete this challenge. Towards the latter part, I found this quite easy going and enjoyed thoroughly trying out a few things prior to arriving at my wanted goal.


I didn't follow exact directions from the starter code but I believe my work still follows coding best practice and is relatively easy to understand and follow.
